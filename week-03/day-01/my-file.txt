I love my computer
You make me feel alright
Every waking hour
And every lonely night
I love my computer
For all you give to me
Predictable errors and no identity
And it's never been quite so easy
I've never been quite so happy
All I need to do is click on you
And we'll be joined
In the most soul-less way
And we'll never
Ever ruin each other's day
'cause when I'm through I just click
And you just go away
